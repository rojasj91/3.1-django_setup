//JavaScript Built-in Data Structures

//Six data types that are primitives:

* boolean
    *true; false; 10 > 5 
    *undefined evaluate to false
    *null evaluates to false
    * +0, -0, NaN evaluates to false
    *empty string ("") evaluates to false
    *a string with anything in it evaluates to true
    
*null
    *represents an object that is not defined
    *can empty an object by setting it to null
    
*undefined
    * represents a value that is undefined
    
*numbers
    * 1, 2.3, -5, 5.4e7
    * type of NaN is a number
    
*string
    * "Oz", "Dietz is a cool dude!", 'That was "cool"'
    
*symbols
    
Anything that doesn't belong to these six primitives is an object {}, function object; array object

JavaScript values

*NaN represents a Number that doesn't make sense, e.g. 0/0

*JavaScript variables are like a container, holder, a label i.e. name.

Declare a variable:
    var color; 
    
Assign a value to variable:
    color = 'blue'
    
Shorthand:
    var color = 'blue'
    
Declare multiple variables:
    var age, color, name
    
Declare and assign multiple variables
    var age = 20, color = 'blue', name = 'Jeff'

Variable naming:
    *First character a-z, A-Z, $, _
    
*var 
    *declares a variable, options initizaling it to the 
    
*let 
    ** Declares a black-scoped, local variable, will not hoist the variable. 

*const
    * Read only. Also does not hoist.
